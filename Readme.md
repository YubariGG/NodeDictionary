I only use this script for personal purposes an not against anyone or any website/ server.


This script is usefull to bypass a login form. The prerequisites to use are:

* We know that there is a user called "admin"
* We have a .txt (or any other text readable file) which we want to try combined with that user.
* We have an endpoint to which we can send infite requests.

Then, we simply call the dictionary file from a JavaScript file and perform one request for each line of the dictionary.

The, wait untill the password is found. To use various dictionaries simply concatenate the .txt files into one, substitute it ot download other ditionaries.
